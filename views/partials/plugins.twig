{#
    Third party plugins that hijack the theme will call wp_footer() to get the footer template.
    We use this to end our output buffer (started in header.php) and render into the view/page-plugin.twig template.

    If you're not using a plugin that requries this behavior (ones that do include Events Calendar Pro and
    WooCommerce) you can delete this file and header.php
